                <h3 class="question">Somebody is missing from the highscore list</h3>
                Players must be looked up to appear on the highscore list. Look them up and they will be added.

                <h3 class="question">When I click a player on the highscore list it says they weren't found</h3>
                The player must have changed their summoner name. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Derpthemeus">Message me on Reddit</a> and I will fix it manually.

                <h3 class="question">Can you add highscore lists for each region?</h3>
                I have no plans to do this. The regional distribution of players looked up on the site is very different from the distribution of player in each region. Data for certain regions (especially ones where English is not the primary language) would not be very accurate

            <div class="col-sm-12 well well-sm">
                <h3 class="question">Can you extend highscore lists beyond 20 players?</h3>
                I have no plans to do this. Data becomes too unreliable past the top players for each champion since players with lower scores are less likely to be looked up (they would only be looked up because somebody encountered them in a game whereas top players may be looked up because they are known among the community).

                <h3 class="question">Can I have a copy of the highscores list?</h3>
                You can download a copy of the data <a href="/downloadData">here</a>. Download your own copy, DO NOT use this site as a CDN. You can download a new copy every 24 hours to keep it current.
                <br>
                It is in JSON format with champion IDs as keys (-1 for total). Each champion contains the top 25 players' name, summoner ID, region (using region codes from <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/regional-endpoints">here</a>, points on the champion, and their standardized name (all lowercase, no spaces)
