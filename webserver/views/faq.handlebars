		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		{{#>question question="Somebody is missing from the highscores list!"}}
			Players must be looked up on the site to appear on the highscores.
			Look them up (using the search box in the top right) and they will be added to the list.
		{{/question}}
		{{#>question question="When I click on a player on the highscores list, it says they weren't found or it brings me to the wrong player!"}}
			<b>If their mastery data is slightly outdated:</b> champion mastery info is cached for 10 minutes. Try refreshing the page in a few minutes to update it.
			<br>
			<b>If a link brought you to a player with a different name, but they have the correct mastery data:</b> the player changed their name, and you have been automatically redirected.
			<br>
			<b>If the mastery data is completely incorrect:</b> this can happen in certain rare situations. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Derpthemeus">Message me on Reddit</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Derpthemeus/ChampionMastery.GG/issues">create an issue on GitHub</a> and I will fix it manually.
		{{/question}}
		{{#>question question="Can you add a separate highscores list for each region?"}}
			I have no plans to do this. The regional distribution of players looked up on the site is very different from the distribution of players from each region.
			Data for certain regions (especially ones where English is not the primary language) would not be very accurate.
		{{/question}}
		{{#>question question="Can you show everybody on the highscores (instead of just the top 50 players)?"}}
			I hope to do this in the future, but it will require a large amount of development work to support.
		{{/question}}
		{{#>question question="Do you have an API for the highscores list?"}}
			Since player IDs from the Riot Games API are different for each application, there isn't a reliable way to share this data.
		{{/question}}
		{{#>question question="Can I have my name removed from the highscores list?"}}
			See <a href="/privacy">this article</a> for information about how you can have your name redacted on the highscores.
